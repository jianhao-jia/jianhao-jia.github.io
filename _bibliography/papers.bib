  abstract = {A large body of work in Computer Science and Operations Research study online algorithms for stochastic resource allocation problems. The most common assumption is that the online requests have randomly generated i.i.d. types. This assumption is well justified for static markets and/or relatively short time periods. We consider dynamic markets, whose states evolve as a random walk in a market-specific Markov Chain. This is a new model that generalizes previous i.i.d. settings. We identify important parameters of the Markov chain that is crucial for obtaining good approximation guarantees to the expected value of the optimal offline algorithm which knows realizations of all requests in advance. We focus on a stylized single-resource setting and: (i) generalize the well-known Prophet Inequality from the optimal stopping theory (single-unit setting) to Markov Chain setting; (ii) in multi-unit setting, design a simple algorithm that is asymptotically optimal under mild assumptions on the underlying Markov chain.},
