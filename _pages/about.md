Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am Jianhao Jia (贾荐豪), a fourth-year Ph.D. student majoring in Theoretical Computer Science at [ITCS](https://itcs.sufe.edu.cn), [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://www.sufe.edu.cn). Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's degree in Information Management at [SIME](https://sime.sufe.edu.cn), [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://www.sufe.edu.cn).

My research interests lie broadly in Theoretical Computer Science, especially topics related to Algorithmic Game Theory and Online Algorithm. I have worked on several projects centered around algorithmic game theory, including conference peer review, bilateral trade, and learning the coalition structure of strategic agents. See my <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/CV.pdf' | relative_url }}">CV</a> and <a href="{{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}">publications</a> for more details about them.

Besides research, I have been actively participating in competitive programming. See my <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/CV.pdf' | relative_url }}">CV</a> for selected awards in OI, ICPC and CCPC. You can also find me in [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/cz_xuyixuan), [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/cz_xuyixuan) and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/progress=cz_xuyixuan).
