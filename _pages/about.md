I am Jianhao Jia (贾荐豪), a fourth-year Ph.D. student majoring in Theoretical Computer Science at [ITCS](https://itcs.sufe.edu.cn), [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://www.sufe.edu.cn). Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's degree in Information Management at [SIME](https://sime.sufe.edu.cn), [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://www.sufe.edu.cn).

My research interests lie broadly in Theoretical Computer Science, especially topics related to Algorithmic Game Theory and Online Algorithm. I have worked on several projects centered around algorithmic game theory, including strategy-proof mechanism design, online resource allocation, etc. See my <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/CV.pdf' | relative_url }}">CV</a> and <a href="{{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}">publications</a> for more details about them.
