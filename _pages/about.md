I am Jianhao Jia (贾荐豪), a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://www.sufe.edu.cn). I am working on Bayesian online algorithms and worst-case analysis of mechanisms without money with [Nick Gravin](https://ngravin.github.io) at [ITCS](https://itcs.sufe.edu.cn). I have completed BS in Information Management at [SIME](https://sime.sufe.edu.cn), [SHUFE](https://www.sufe.edu.cn).
I am broadly interested in Theoretical Computer Science and Optimization, especially topics related to Algorithmic Game Theory and Online Algorithms.
